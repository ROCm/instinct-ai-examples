# Welcome to Instinct AI Examples

This repository is a collection of examples to enable new users to start using the ROCm AI SW stack for testing different workloads and building proof of concept demos. There are two main categories for the examples:
- Getting started AI examples: these samples are mostly command line scripts that can be run to test and yield simple benchmarks.
- Demo building templates: these templates can be used to build quick demos on top of AMD GPUs with the proper configurations to also experience good performance.

Please Note: this is repository is not designed for performance validation or creating competitive benchmarks. For performance validation please refer to our official AI performance validation documentation.
